Project Description 
------------------- 
Frequent travellers may have to carry precious luggage over long distances. In many cases, the luggage of the client is hidden from sight. For example, when the client is travelling by train and has an upper berth, or when travelling by a bus with a separate cargo hold. In crowded areas, the luggage is susceptible to theft or improper handling. The device aims to protect the client from such issues.
